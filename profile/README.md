### Who are we?
We are a motivated group of students studying Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Western Ontario, currently in our second year of studies.<br><br>

We are:

- Josh Muszka (<a href="https://github.com/jmuszka">jmuszka</a>)
- Nicholas Woo (<a href="https://github.com/Knightlynick">Knightlynick</a>)
- Michael Quick (<a href="https://github.com/ExplorerDonutz">ExplorerDonutz</a>)
- Eunsung Kim (<a href="https://github.com/jerpyk">jerpyk</a>)

In our spare time, we enjoy coding and playing video games together. As a result, when we met in the first semester of our first year we immediately got along well and became fast friends. Then in second semester, we decided to get together and form Raging Goose Development; a group where we could work together on things we are passionate for.<br><br>

### Our mission
We're a bunch of tech enthusiasts eager to make our mark in the industry. We all strive to learn new skills and improve our capabilities. We formed Raging Goose Development so we could work together on projects that are both fun and a great opportunity to learn. So far we have acquired valuable knowledge about machine learning and game development, vastly improved our programming and problem solving skills, and learned how to collaborate as a team.<br><br>

<br><br>
In the future, we seek to delve into the depths of Arduino hardware, full-stack web apps, and many other things that perplex us. Raging Goose Development is a canvas for us to explore things that we enjoy while simultaneously preparing ourselves for our future career.<br><br>

### Projects
Rogue Trails
- A procedurally-generated dungeon-crawling game made in Java with the libGDX game engine. The three of us enjoy playing games, so developing our own game is the next logical step. The goal of this project is to gain experience with larger software projects, and learn industry practices relating to collaborative development. Click <a href="https://github.com/raginggoosedev/RogueTrails">here</a> to see the project. (work-in-progress)

DataQuest 2023
- Western AI, a club which we are proud members of, hosted a machine learning hackathon in March 2023. The challenge was to train models based on provided data and make accurate predictions about the future. We used various Python libraries to parse and process data, as well as to train and do calculations. Click <a href="https://github.com/raginggoosedev/DataQuest">here</a> to see the project.
